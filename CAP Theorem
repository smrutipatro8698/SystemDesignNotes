C - Consistent, A - Availability, P - Partition tolerance 

Consistency -Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Availability - Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
Partition tolerance - The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

When a network partition failure happens, it must be decided whether to
  - cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency or to
  - proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency.
  
  If no partition, both C and A can be achieved.
